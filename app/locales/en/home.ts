The game still went live a day before expected release. As far as the game goes it’s literally palworld with different creatures. Almost every other aspect is exactly the same. It’s not bad but I think a little too ambitious for mobile. Game suffers a little from the controls being small. Probably better on a tablet. Overall though really cool",
